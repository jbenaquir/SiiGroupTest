Hi I'm Leo:

Open with Visual Studio 2022 

MVC.NET
Framework 6.0 required

Once opened Solution
1. Go to [SiiGroupTest] do second clic and Setup as Start up Project
2. Run to open browser and check

NOTE:
API https://dummy... sometimes returns (too often)
429 Too Many Requests
so be patient

3. Go to [TestProject] do second clic and search option Run Tests.

Regards.
